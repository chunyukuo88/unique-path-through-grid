# App.js/calculateUniquePaths

This algorithm solves the problem laid out in the file called ./src/speg.png.

It has been developed in a 100% test-driven manner and includes an additional optional parameter that facilitates unit testing (since the number of obstacles is random) and also allows the algorithm to calculate the number of unique paths in cases where there are no obstacles in the grid.

Most of the original code I wrote on Thursday, July 22, 2021 proved to be irrelevant to the final solution, but I am keeping it in the "visualizations" folder for my own reference.
